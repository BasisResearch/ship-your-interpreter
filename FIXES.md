# Lean 4.34 port fixes (MBP overnight)

Prior fixes: ~/vsa-iris-spike-logs/prior-fixes.patch

## Fixed

- `Vsa/Sim/RamReadVirtual.lean` — simp unfolding (`EStateM.pure`/`EStateM.bind` no longer
  collapse `pure () >>= k` in a Sail `do` block, so the misalignment `ite_self` stopped firing
  and `rw [hsplit]` lost its pattern): added the local `rfl` lemma `pure_unit_bindCont` and one
  simp argument.
