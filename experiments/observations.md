# Observations ledger — missing general facts, workarounds, abstraction candidates

Append-only channel from working agents to the coordinator. APPEND AN ENTRY THE
MOMENT YOU NOTICE, not in your final report — entries on disk survive agent
stalls; final reports don't. The coordinator harvests entries into the task
board; harvested entries get a `> harvested: <task#/decision>` line, and stay
here as the record.

Entry format (append at the END of this file):

```
## <date> <short-slug> (<task or agent context>)
- missing: <the general fact/lemma/abstraction that does not exist>
- workaround: <what you did instead, or NONE if you stopped>
- cost: <what the workaround cost — lines, decides, per-site work — and who
  else will pay it again>
- proposal: <the abstraction that would eliminate the class, named concretely>
```

Rules: one entry per observation; never edit others' entries; a workaround
noted here is NOT thereby sanctioned — if the discipline gate or brief forbids
it, still stop and report instead.

## 2026-08-31 keys-decides-per-seg (bridgeOfSeg, task #28)
- missing: keys (evalBlocks bs L).regs ⊆ keysG L ++ wrChain bs (fold subset lemma)
- workaround: caller-supplied hKeysOut/hRaOut per concrete seg, by decide
- cost: 2 extra decides per bridge row, forever, until the lemma lands
- proposal: one structural-induction subset lemma; hypotheses become derivable
> harvested: task #31

## 2026-08-31 site-batteries-beside-tabled-region (env_define bridges, task #6)
- missing: nothing — the decode table already covered the region 106/106
- workaround: four hand prefix-run site batteries were written beside it
- cost: ~58 lines + ~10 site lemmas per prefix, four times
- proposal: discipline gate (landed: check_all stage a4) + EnvDefSeg model
> harvested: tasks #27/#28, gate committed f2670f5
